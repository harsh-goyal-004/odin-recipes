        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has gained widespread popularity 
           worldwide due to its rich flavors and hearty composition. Traditionally, 
           it consists of layers of wide, flat pasta alternated with fillings that 
           typically include ground meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. 
           <br><br>
           The meat sauce, often a rag√π made with beef, pork, or both, is simmered to develop a deep,
           savory flavor. Cheese, particularly ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan, is
           generously applied to add creaminess and richness. Each layer is carefully
           assembled, and the dish is baked until the top is golden and bubbling, resulting
           in a comforting, indulgent meal.
